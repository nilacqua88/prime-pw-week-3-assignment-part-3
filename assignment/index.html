      <li> Had a question on # 9 of part 3 of this weeks assignemnt. I couldn't get the supplyChanges to work on this
        it was giving me the number 0. A couple of us went over it and then tried to rename the supplyChanges
        and this worked just fine. But we couldn't find the problem with supplyChanges. Any thoughts?</li>
